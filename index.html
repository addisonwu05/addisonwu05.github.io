      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey! I'm a rising junior studying computer science at Princeton University. I was born in the Bay Area ðŸŒ‰ but have lived in Kingston, Ontario, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ for my entire life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I got started with machine learning as a researcher with the <a href="https://www.mpilab.ca/" target="_blank">Multi-Physics Interaction Lab</a> at the University of Waterloo, where I was lucky to be advised by <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/j6hickey" target="_blank">Prof. Jean-Pierre Hickey</a> on developing better methods to locate low-frequency noise in the atmosphere with neural networks.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Nowadays, I've shifted my focus to better understanding the capabilities and limitations of large foundation models through a human-centered lens as a researcher with the <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php" target="_blank">Computational Cognitive Science Lab</a>, where I'm grateful to be advised by <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php" target="_blank">Prof. Tom Griffiths</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        LLMs have become smarter than ever, but does that necessarily mean they can practically interact with us effectively? Can they understand our goals, communicate clearly, or behave appropriately and consistently in real-world situations â€” i.e., can they do more than just serve as an encyclopedia-on-call?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What better way to find out than to study how they respond in the same kinds of uncertain, socially stimulating scenarios that humans also navigate? I believe that each step toward answering these questions brings us closer to a future where the relationship between humans and technology can evolve symbiotically â€” guided by a positive feedback loop of understanding, adaptation, and trust.
      </p>
